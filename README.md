I'm a software engineer with experience with the technologies listed in the toolbox below.  

A problem solver by nature, I enjoy building things that can be useful for people.

I'm currently working in market research where I use JavaScript / Python to write algorithms inside of SASS platforms creating online surveys for Pharma clients.

I've created a portfolio which you can see by clicking [here](https://www.cossi.dev/).  Looking forward to creating more interesting applications and solutions for internet users.
